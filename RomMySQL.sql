It can\n\rbe found on Rehobaom\'s Legacy, at hypercube.org 9000.\n\r\n\rThe following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:\n\r\n\rSocials --\n\r    Kelsey and Liralen\n\r\n\rNew, Improved Valhalla --\n\r    Liralen\n\r\n\rPuff\'s new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --\n\r    Seth\n\r\n\rMaps and map shop --\n\r    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)\n\r\n\rNirvana zone --\n\r    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)\n\r\n\rMob Factory --\n\r    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)\n\r\n\rGeographically correct Midgaard (tm) --\n\r    Alander\n\r\n\rIdeas and playtesting --\n\r    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world\n\r\n\rThe New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator\n\rof the ASCII flags used in the zone files\n\r\n\rBeta testing --\n\r    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bugs reports\n\r    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches\n\r\n\rBug reports --\n\r    Thanks to Shad Muegge, Jerome Despret, Phoenix, Will Hongach,\n\r    Erwin S. Andreasen, Adam Debus and especially Gary Turkington\n\r    (author of the ROM FAQ) for help spotting bugs\n\r\n\rROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release\n\rshares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code\n\rwas written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions\n\rand ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty\'s work on\n\rMoosehead also remain.\n\r\n\rThe new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with\n\rGabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn\'t\n\rhave happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and\n\rwiznet are the results of Gabrielle\'s ideas.\n\r\n\rChanges to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes\n\rto Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of\n\rhair-pulling.

There is a\n\rdefault skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced\n\rselection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.\n\r\n\rThe experience breakdown is as follows:\n\rpoints   exp/level     points   exp/level\n\r40        1000         90        6000\n\r50        1500         100       8000\n\r60	  2000         110      12000\n\r70        3000         120      16000\n\r80        4000         130      24000\n\rThe table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.\n\r'),(179,-1,'BASICS \'ROM BASICS\'','The basic skills:\n\r\n\rEvery character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default\n\rset that all characters receive.

Most of their\n\rspells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells\n\rbeing far less powerful than those of mages. However, clerics are the best\n\rclass by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive area of\n\rprotective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.\n\r\n\rAll clerics begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must\n\rbe purchased, many at a very dear cost.

It\n\rcan be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.\n\rThe damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker\'s level, his\n\rweapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.\n\rOnly thieves may learn the backstab.\n\r'),(204,-1,'BASH','The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock\n\ryour foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the\n\rbash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon\n\ris not generally a wise idea.\n\r'),(205,-1,'BERSERK','Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage\n\rin combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge\n\rsurge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.\n\rBerserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.\n\r'),(206,-1,'DIRT \'DIRT KICKING\'','Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever\n\rcombatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The\n\rblindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity\n\rhelps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may\n\rlearn this skill.\n\r'),(207,-1,'DISARM','Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your\n\ropponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you\n\rare skilled both your own and your opponent\'s weapon. Only talented thieves\n\rand warriors may learn this skill.\n\r'),(208,-1,'DODGE','In the words of one wise warrior, \'the best way to block a blow is to not\n\rbe where it lands\'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the\n\rcharacter\'s natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the\n\rtarget. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the\n\rattacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.\n\r'),(209,-1,'\'ENHANCED DAMAGE\'','Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are\n\rable to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked\n\rfor with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus\n\ris very low indeed.\n\r'),(210,-1,'ENVENOM','The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to\n\rwin a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.\n\rOr, put another way, it\'s a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.\n\rFood, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned\n\rfood or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to\n\rbe more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could\n\rdrink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on\n\rthe other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison\n\rburns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates\n\rquickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.\n\r'),(211,-1,'\'HAND TO HAND\'','Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this\n\rstyle of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.\n\rTrained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many swordsmen.\n\rClerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and mages\n\rmay also learn it.\n\r'),(212,-1,'KICK','Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful\n\rkick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters\n\rand clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although thieves may also learn\n\rit.\n\r'),(213,-1,'PARRY','If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting\n\rattacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for\n\rfull success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced\n\rdamage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the\n\rdefender is skilled in both his and his opponent\'s weapon type.\n\r'),(214,-1,'RESCUE','A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with\n\rthe rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede\n\rin combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the\n\rfavor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as\n\rwell as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and\n\rthe target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)\n\r'),(215,-1,'TRIP','Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves\n\rusing any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.\n\rTripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will\n\rfind the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.\n\r'),(216,-1,'\'SECOND ATTACK\'','Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes\n\rin combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every\n\rround.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a\n\rvery hard time with it.\n\r'),(217,-1,'\'THIRD ATTACK\'','Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike\n\rin a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect\n\rthird attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Only warriors and highly\n\rskilled thieves may learn this skill.\n\r'),(218,-1,'HIDE SNEAK','Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.\n\rHide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the\n\rcharacter remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to\n\rsneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and\n\rthieves may learn these skills.\n\r'),(219,-1,'\'FAST HEALING\'','The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,\n\ror sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general\n\rtoughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is\n\rpossible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it\n\rvery difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.\n\r'),(220,-1,'LORE','Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use\n\rof the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,\n\rconcerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value\n\rof an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may\n\rlearn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard\n\rto use.\n\r'),(221,-1,'HAGGLE HAGGLING','Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to\n\rmatch wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,\n\ror to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are\n\ralready very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best\n\rguard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling,\n\ralthough other classes may learn it as well.\n\r'),(222,-1,'PEEK','The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,\n\rthe better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are\n\rharder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most\n\rcommon practicioners.\n\r'),(223,-1,'PICK \'PICK LOCK\'','Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain\n\raccess to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by\n\rintelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may\n\rlearn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.\n\r'),(224,-1,'MEDITATION','This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and\n\rmantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.\n\rThieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have\n\rmuch trouble learning to meditate.\n\r'),(225,-1,'STEAL \'STEAL SKILL\'','Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.\n\rIt allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,\n\rand even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise\n\rcarefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag\n\rif you are caught (making you free game for killing).\n\r'),(226,-1,'\'DETECT GOOD\'','Syntax: cast \'detect good\'\n\r\n\rThis spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will\n\rreveal a characteristic golden aura.\n\r'),(227,-1,'\'DISPEL GOOD\'','Syntax: cast \'dispel good\' <victim>\n\r\n\rDispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on\n\rthe pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their\n\rperil.\n\r'),(228,-1,'\'RECHARGE\'','Syntax: cast \'recharge\' <item>\n\r\n\rThe recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.\n\rFully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell\n\ris proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be\n\rrecharged one time successfully.\n\r'),(229,-1,'\'DEMONFIRE\'','Syntax: cast \'demonfire\' <target>\n\r\n\rDemonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those\n\rwho follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to\n\rinflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.\n\r'),(230,-1,'\'RAY OF TRUTH\'','Syntax: cast \'ray of truth\' <target>\n\r\n\rRay of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth\n\ra beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants\n\rof evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike\n\rcasters who are tainted by evil.\n\r'),(231,-1,'\'PORTAL\'','Syntax: cast \'portal\' <target>\n\r\n\rThe portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal\n\rto the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are\n\rentered using \'enter\' or \'go\' command, as in \'go portal\'.  Portals cannot\n\rbe made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.\n\rPortal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the\n\rsecret of this material component has been lost...\n\r'),(232,-1,'\'NEXUS\'','Syntax: cast \'nexus\' <target>\n\r\n\rThis spell is virtually identical to portal (see \'help portal\'), with the\n\ronly difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus\n\rspell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered\n\rportal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret\n\rof which has been lost...\n\r'),(233,-1,'\'HEAT METAL\'','Syntax: cast \'heat metal\' <target>\n\r\n\rHeat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary\n\raccording to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment\n\r(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,\n\rcausing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the\n\rprocess (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).\n\rThis spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.\n\r'),(234,-1,'\'HOLY WORD\'','Syntax: cast \'holy word\'\n\r\n\rHoly word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric\'s god, with\n\rdisasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful\n\rblessings on the priest\'s allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the\n\rroom are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of\n\ropposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)\n\rare struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers\n\rgreatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and\n\rdrained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.\n\r'),(235,-1,'FRENZY','Syntax: cast \'frenzy\' <target>\n\r\n\rThe frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing\n\rhis or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine\n\rwrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety,\n\rmaking the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm\n\rspell (see \'help calm\'), and may only be used on those of the caster\'s\n\ralignment.\n\r'),(236,-1,'CALM','Syntax: cast \'calm\'\n\r\n\rOne of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is\n\rthe calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed\n\rcreatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage\n\rin combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence\n\ractivity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --\n\reither all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who\n\rare immune to magic) or none is.\n\r'),(237,-1,'HASTE','Syntax: cast \'haste\' <target>\n\r\n\rThe haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing\n\ran extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive\n\rabilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,\n\rsuch that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating\n\rthe slow spell. (see \'help slow\').\n\r'),(238,-1,'SLOW','Syntax: cast \'slow\' <target>\n\r\n\rDespite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell\n\rwith it\'s own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,\n\rit slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate\n\rof attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and halve healing\n\rrates, due to reduced metabolism.\n\r'),(239,-1,'PLAGUE','Syntax: cast \'plague\' <target>\n\r\n\rThe plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,\n\rsapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to\n\rdeath.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like\n\rwildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.\n\r'),(240,-1,'\'CREATE ROSE\'','Syntax: cast \'create rose\'\n\r\n\rA romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game\n\ruse whatsoever.\n\r'),(241,-1,'\'PROTECTION GOOD\' \'PROTECTION EVIL\'','Syntax: cast \'protection evil\' <target>\n\r	cast \'protection good\' <target>\n\r\n\rThe protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate\n\rethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not\n\rbe cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same\n\rtime.\n\r'),(242,0,'\'GIANT STRENGTH\'','Syntax: cast \'giant strength\' <character>\n\r\n\rThis spell increases the strength of the target character.\n\r'),(243,-1,'\'CHAIN LIGHTNING\'','Syntax : cast \'chain lightning\' <target>\n\r\n\rChain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning\n\rthat arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully\n\rexpended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members\n\rof a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other\n\rviable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on\n\rgroups of creatures.\n\r'),(244,-1,'FARSIGHT','Syntax: cast \'farsight\'\n\r	cast \'farsight\' <direction>\n\r\n\rThe farsight spell expands the caster\'s consciousness, allowing him or her\n\rto see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense\n\rconcentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.\n\rThe spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in\n\rall directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much\n\rfarther away.\n\r'),(245,-1,'MASS HEALING','Syntax: cast \'mass healing\'\n\r\n\rThe mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell\n\ron all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good\n\rmeasure.\n\r'),(246,-1,'\'FLOATING DISC\'','Syntax: cast \'floating disc\'\n\r\n\rThis useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caser\n\raround, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight\n\rpenalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and\n\rusually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a\n\rmaximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location\n\ron the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it\n\rto run out of energy.\n\r'),(247,-1,'FIREPROOF','Syntax: cast \'fireproof\' <object>\n\r\n\rThe fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,\n\rto protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected\n\rby this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.\n\rAlthough inexpensive to use, the spell\'s short duration makes it impractical\n\rfor protecting large numbers of objects.\n\r'),(248,-1,'ALIAS UNALIAS','Syntax: alias\n\r	alias <word>\n\r	alias <word> <substitution>\n\r	unalias <word>\n\r\n\rThe alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,\n\raliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.\n\rAlias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with\n\rthat name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument\n\rproduces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new\n\rcommand.  Examples of use:\n\r\n\ralias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing \'get all corpse\'\n\ralias ff cast \'fireball\' --> ff orc will equal \'cast \'fireball\' orc\'\n\r\n\rOnly the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.\n\r');
