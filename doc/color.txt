Rom 2.4b6 with 8bit colors ------

Color codes are defined in color.h not to make an unreadable merc.h file.

Predefined colors are common web colors with names. You can find the
complete list from:
https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp

Colors are defined with RGB codes like (<number>,<number>,<number>).
Every number has a range from 0 to 255.

RGB(a,b,c) macro convert the RGB code to a string starting with an escape
character and a value that defined 8bit color code. I didn't prefer
to defined the colors with a non-readable escape code. RGB codes make it more
readable and also easy to add new values.

Color is only used in do_who() function in act_info.c file to demonstrate the
usage.

A sample screenshot of who command output can be find media folder.
